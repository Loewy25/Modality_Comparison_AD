 includes more than three million fingerspelled characters produced by over 100 Deaf signers captured via the selfie camera of a smartphone with a variety of backgrounds and lighting conditions. These signers represent diverse regions across the United States and predominantly use American Sign Language (ASL) for communication. They reflect a mix of skin tones and genders. Fingerspelling, a part of ASL, employs hand shapes to convey individual letters, commonly used for names, addresses, and phone numbers, and is often faster than mobile typing. ASL fingerspelling can significantly outpace smartphone keyboard typing (average 57 words/minute versus the U.S. average of 36 words/minute). However, AI for sign language recognition in text entry lags behind voice-to-text and gesture-based typing due to the scarcity of robust datasets. It's the same for people who are deaf (or live a significant portion of their life with the deaf/interact daily) they can sign with 1 hand and gesture in other ways that the flow of conversation does not slow down & the 2 communicate fluently
